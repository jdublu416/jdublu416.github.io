    <h1>How to make A Porkroll Sandwich</h1>
    <h2>The best sandwich you'll ever have!</h2>

        <p>First thing one should do is hunt for porkroll at the grocery
            store! This will be a challenge here in Virginia since it has 
            gone by the wayside as a popular breakfast meat.

            <li>Put two slices of bread in the toaster to your desired
                darkness; butter.</li>
            <li>Take porkroll slice (I use two) in frying pan on medium heat</li>
            <li>Fry one egg to over medium</li>
            <li>Assemble sandwich with all three ingredients</li>
            <li>I add dijon mustard for my condiment in lieu of butter! Amazing flavor marriage...</li>
